## 📜 Academic objectives

In the evaluation of the students’ performance, emphasis is placed on the extent to which the students are able to:

### 🧠 Knowledge

- Demonstrate insight into digital interaction paradigms and technologies and the theoretical perspectives, historical development and specific uses of these
- Demonstrate an understanding of interaction technologies and their potential for supporting different interaction forms and situations
- Demonstrate insight into how to construct using interaction technologies and how to plan experiments and development processes

### 🛠️ Skills

- Analyse and asses interactive digital artefacts and situations based on current and historical interaction paradigms, including how they affect human relations
- Plan and carry out practice-based prototypes, experiments and development processes

### 🎓 Competences

- Organise and carry out designs of interactive digital artefacts and situations
- Reflect on how interaction paradigms and technologies influence the relationship between humans, technology and the surrounding world

## 📋 IxT Exam

The exam is a oral exam based on a presentation of, as well as an analysis and reflection on interactive artefacts and their relation to various interaction paradigms and technologies, including their own programmed interactive artefacts. Duration: 30 minutes. The assessment is based solely on the oral presentation.
